When working in typescript:

- when adding a package to a project add it with an install command, instead of manually editing the package json
- run check/format/lint commands when your done making a change. if they don't exist, suggest making them for the project you're in
- avoid explicit return types unless absolutely needed
- `as any` should be an absolute last resort. always use real type safety. lean on type inference instead of manually writing new types over and over again

In general:

- when asking questions, ask them one at a time
- use `aside_repl` when work requires web research, browser automation, logged-in websites, screenshots, or downloads; fall back to the `mcp` proxy if the direct tool is unavailable
- prefer Aside's autonomous browser agent for whole web tasks and its direct browser automation tools when exact page state or deterministic interaction matters
